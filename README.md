# UGNN: The Unfolded Graph Neural Networks package.

Welcome to the documentation for **UGNN**, a library for using the **unfolded graph neural network** (UGNN) model for discrete-time dynamic graphs.

For more details on this model, see the paper: [Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230).
